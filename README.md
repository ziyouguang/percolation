# network percolation
We develop a new model of heterogeneous multi-coupled interdependent networks and analyse the change in the giant component of the network after the attack in conjunction with a new load redistribution mechanism.

Also, you can use your own network model to calculate
$$percolation(G, G1, G2, p1, p2, alpha)$$
G is interdependent network, G1 is WS sub-network and G2 is BA sub-network, p1 is the proportion of nodes that attack the WS sub-network, p2 is the proportion of nodes on BA sub-network, and alpha is the coupling strength between dependency nodes.
